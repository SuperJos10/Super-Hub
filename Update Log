Log #1

1. Update log has been added

3. Discord server discontinued

Yes sadly the discord server project got discontinued because the hard time that I am going through still hasn't fully stopped yet and I still have school on weekdays
Hopefully in the future if this project stays a thing and still exists then I will attempt to add a discord again...
Who knows? It could be closer than you think ;)



















































Yeah no it probably won't exist soon
