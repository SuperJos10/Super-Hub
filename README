Hello There!
You are obviously here reading this file and to that I say thank you

IMPORTANT:
1. Pls no copy or I be sad :(
2. Yes this script is completely made by me no group or team so it has been published opensource for an easy way to copy
3. Please don't use in your own projects without crediting me
4. Enjoy the script before the anticheat (The anticheat will probably patch this script so...)
5. I am not trying to compete with other scripthubs or scripts this is just a fun project to help me learn more about lua and coding
6. Read the update log often for important information
7. Just use it and have some fun!!!!

Thank you and have a great rest of your day!
